Hey, have you heard about the new Art and
Crafts community called TulipArt?

00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:07,541
No, what is it about?

00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:19,291
It's a platform for artists and crafters
to share their artworks with the world. You can share your paintings, drawings, sculptures, and even DIY crafts.

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,916
That sounds interesting. Is it only for
professional artists?

No, it's for everyone who loves art and
crafts. You can be a beginner or a professional. The platform is all about sharing your passion for art with others. It's all about creativity and diversity.

That sounds amazing. I can't wait to join
the community and start sharing my artworks.
